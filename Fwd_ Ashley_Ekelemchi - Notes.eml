reporting to Dave and Dan and Helen. I=E2=80=99ve asked several times =
now, including today, that all 1:1s with them be in writing only, during =
the duration of this investigation. I also asked that there not be any =
new projects added to my workload during the duration of this =
investigation, and this is especially important now that my manager =

what a single role is capable of, and all unfavorable work. I would like =

his current actions with this workload as retaliation and a negative =

discussed. First, a new role at Apple that is not a hostile work =

because I will not be at Apple after Dec 31 2022, I cannot find a new =
role to transfer to for such a short period of time, so I need your =
assistance with placement). The 2nd option is an exit package that will =
compensate me and provide benefits through that time. As mentioned this =
would only be a payment & exit to mitigate the current hostile work =
environment and unsafe work conditions and would not include any =
litigation/arbitration waiver agreements nor any non-disclosure =
agreements beyond what I=E2=80=99ve already signed as an employee. Any =
